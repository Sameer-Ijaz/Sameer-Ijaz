00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.070
And look, I've been coaching men for well over a decade from special forces to some of the greatest rock bands in the world.

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.650
And what I've learned is confidence is not something you're going to think your way to.

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.110
It is something you have to build with action.

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.730
So today I'm going to talk to you about ways to actually build your confidence.

5
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.730
And it's not going to happen through affirmations, right?

6
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.270
We're going to have to get out into the real world and make things happen.

7
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.557
So...

8
00:00:26.558 --> 00:00:31.138
One of the things in the context of what we're dealing with right now is women.

9
00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:35.518
Women don't really care as much what you say.

10
00:00:35.978 --> 00:00:38.578
All they care about is how you make them feel.

11
00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:44.714
And one of the biggest attraction markers for women when it comes to an energy exchange is,

12
00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:53.494
is is he confident is he sure of himself has he been here before does he know how this game this

13
00:00:53.495 --> 00:00:59.574
interaction works and let's be honest a lot of guys know right we just haven't had the reps we

14
00:00:59.575 --> 00:01:05.574
haven't been to batting cage and not to really get that good swing down so you have to go get your at

15
00:01:05.575 --> 00:01:06.675
bats right

16
00:01:07.092 --> 00:01:13.831
With that energy exchange, you have to give her this presence of one of the things women need the most, which is safety and security.

17
00:01:13.832 --> 00:01:17.612
She has to feel what you're saying to her.

18
00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:21.432
And all this comes from a grounded place of confidence.

19
00:01:21.872 --> 00:01:23.612
So here's what I'm going to give you today, guys.

20
00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:29.146
Your challenge today is to go play the compliment game.

21
00:01:29.147 --> 00:01:32.307
A lot of guys that I work with do have a hard time approaching women.

22
00:01:32.407 --> 00:01:35.187
They have a hard time having conversations with women.

23
00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:39.147
So what I want to do today is I just want to get you used to having conversations.

24
00:01:39.447 --> 00:01:44.347
I want to get you used to just having conversations, going up and talking to somebody and saying,

25
00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:45.547
this is who I am.

26
00:01:45.687 --> 00:01:46.607
Just want to come say, hey.

27
00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:49.447
So here's how the compliment challenge works.

28
00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:56.687
I want you to just find the next five people you interact with and just pay them a compliment.

29
00:01:56.974 --> 00:01:58.614
Here's the caveat to this.

30
00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:01.954
I don't want you to compliment something about their physical attractiveness.

31
00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:05.614
I want you to think outside the box here, because here's the magic.

32
00:02:05.974 --> 00:02:11.494
Think about either a decision they had to make or something that they had to actually think about.

33
00:02:11.754 --> 00:02:13.294
It could be something they're wearing.

34
00:02:13.414 --> 00:02:16.274
Could be, you know, maybe she's got a purple stripe in her hair.

35
00:02:16.954 --> 00:02:21.341
Maybe she's got like, maybe she's got some decorated Chuck keys on.

36
00:02:21.342 --> 00:02:23.782
Maybe she's got like a Van Halen t-shirt on.

37
00:02:24.382 --> 00:02:26.522
Maybe she's just got some great energy.

38
00:02:26.922 --> 00:02:30.522
Which, by the way, leads me into my number one hack here.

39
00:02:30.982 --> 00:02:33.542
If you ever don't know what to say to a girl...

40
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.450
Just say, wow, you have amazing energy.

41
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.890
Watch what happens.

42
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.630
Guys, it's something in the way that women receive that compliment.

43
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.270
I promise you it lands and it works.

44
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.590
But you're having like you're just going up to somebody and just giving them a compliment.

45
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.250
And here's what I also want to remember.

46
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.190
This is a non-outcome based compliment.

47
00:02:57.032 --> 00:03:01.632
I don't want you thinking I have to get this compliment and get something in return.

48
00:03:02.052 --> 00:03:05.272
No, the point of this challenge is to just go be a good human.

49
00:03:05.692 --> 00:03:10.371
Go change five people's day and watch the energy exchange that happens.

50
00:03:10.372 --> 00:03:14.472
Watch what happens when you take an outcome off of the conversation.

51
00:03:14.932 --> 00:03:18.884
Just go pay a compliment and watch how that other person reacts.

52
00:03:18.885 --> 00:03:22.085
Also, watch how much easier it gets for you.

53
00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:24.325
When you're not trying to land the number,

54
00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:25.545
trying to land the date,

55
00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:27.585
and you're not trying to get something out of that person,

56
00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:30.604
all you're doing is trying to be a good human

57
00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:32.385
and just go be a good guy.

58
00:03:32.885 --> 00:03:35.585
When that's your sole goal,

59
00:03:36.368 --> 00:03:37.768
that interaction becomes a lot easier.

60
00:03:38.108 --> 00:03:39.228
And here's what I want you to do.

61
00:03:39.668 --> 00:03:42.968
I want you to go find five people today to go do that too.

62
00:03:43.548 --> 00:03:45.548
Then I want you to make that a daily habit.

63
00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:47.348
That's just something deeply ingrained.

64
00:03:47.468 --> 00:03:50.528
It kind of weirds my girl for now because I do it so much,

65
00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:53.868
but it's become the daily ingrained habit in who I am right now.

66
00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:55.869
I just pay compliments everywhere I go.

67
00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.289
Hey, bro, look at your shoes, man.

68
00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:00.049
Like, bro, how can I get in the gym like you?

69
00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.489
Or, wow, this coffee is absolutely amazing.

70
00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:04.049
Did you make this?

71
00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.729
Something as simple as that is what it's all about.

72
00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:10.228
So that's your challenge today, guys.

73
00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:14.049
Go have as many of those compliment challenge games as possible.

74
00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:17.679
I want to talk to you in the coming videos about what to do after that.

75
00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.578
But I want you to get really good at this.

76
00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:26.659
The number one thing that I hear in feedback from guys doing this challenge is people aren't so scary, are they?

77
00:04:27.854 --> 00:04:29.234
Like, no, they're human just like you.

78
00:04:29.314 --> 00:04:33.294
I promise you, the people you're talking to are probably just as insecure and scary as you are.

79
00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:42.133
Go just pay compliments, be a good human, and watch how that changes your confidence level and approaching people moving forward.

80
00:04:42.134 --> 00:04:45.874
Because, guys, we're building confidence through action, not through just thinking about it.

81
00:04:46.214 --> 00:04:47.293
So, guys, that's what...

82
00:04:47.294 --> 00:04:50.794
have for you today. That's today's video. I'm going to see you tomorrow where we're going to

83
00:04:50.794 --> 00:04:55.074
talk about a little bit more of the growth mindset and how to reframe things. And that's just going

84
00:04:55.074 --> 00:05:01.473
to build upon what we're doing today. So make sure you take action today, guys. Also, host in the

85
00:05:01.474 --> 00:05:06.614
community. Give us feedback how this challenge went. Let us know what happened when you started

86
00:05:06.614 --> 00:05:10.554
paying compliments to people and what happened in those interactions. All right, guys, that's it.

87
00:05:10.754 --> 00:05:11.974
I'm Robbie and I'll see you tomorrow.
