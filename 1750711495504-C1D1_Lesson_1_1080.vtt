00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.070
And look, I've been coaching men for well over a dec...cial forces to some of the greatest rock bands in the world.

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.650
And what I've learned is confidence is not something you're going to think your way to.

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.110
It is something you have to build with action.

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.730
So today I'm going to talk to you about ways to actually build your confidence.

5
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.730
And it's not going to happen through affirmations, right?

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.390
It's not going to happen through you standing in the mirror and telling yourself I'm confident.

7
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.630
It's going to happen by you going out and doing things that are courageous.

8
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.970
You have to put yourself out there.

9
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.370
So today I want you to think about this.

10
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.300
Confidence is built through evidence.

11
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.710
Confidence is built through evidence.

12
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.110
Confidence is built through evidence.

13
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.390
The evidence that you can do something.

14
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.610
The evidence that you can handle something.

15
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.430
The evidence that you can produce a certain outcome.

16
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.750
You have to go out and gather evidence.

17
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.290
If you want to build your confidence, you need evidence.

18
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.750
Now, where do you get evidence?

19
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.110
You get evidence by doing courageous things.

20
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.470
By putting yourself out there and going after what you want.

21
00:01:05.575 --> 00:01:06.675
bats right

22
00:01:07.092 --> 00:01:13.832
With that energy exchange, you have to give her this presence... the things women need the most, which is safety and security.

23
00:01:13.832 --> 00:01:17.612
She has to feel what you're saying to her.

24
00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:21.432
And all this comes from a grounded place of confidence.

25
00:01:21.872 --> 00:01:23.612
So here's what I'm going to give you today, guys.

26
00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:29.152
Your challenge today is to do something courageous.

27
00:01:29.392 --> 00:01:31.672
To gather evidence.

28
00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:34.832
Something that you may be avoiding.

29
00:01:34.992 --> 00:01:37.432
Something that makes you feel uncomfortable.

30
00:01:37.632 --> 00:01:41.152
Something that you feel a little fear around.

31
00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:44.592
And it doesn't have to be a massive thing.

32
00:01:44.752 --> 00:01:48.352
An example could be going to the gym.

33
00:01:48.512 --> 00:01:51.032
Going to a gym class.

34
00:01:51.192 --> 00:01:53.832
Maybe you've been saying you want to get in shape.

35
00:01:53.992 --> 00:01:56.272
Maybe you've been saying you want to lose weight.

36
00:01:56.432 --> 00:01:59.632
Maybe you've been saying you want to build muscle.

37
00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:02.112
And you haven't been taking action.

38
00:02:02.352 --> 00:02:04.792
You can go gather evidence today.

39
00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:07.432
Another example could be talking to a woman you like.

40
00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:10.472
Maybe there's a woman at your workplace.

41
00:02:10.632 --> 00:02:13.272
Maybe there's a woman somewhere you see regularly.

42
00:02:13.472 --> 00:02:16.352
Maybe a barista at a coffee shop.

43
00:02:16.512 --> 00:02:19.032
And you want to speak to her.

44
00:02:19.192 --> 00:02:21.832
You want to ask her out.

45
00:02:21.992 --> 00:02:24.112
But you've been avoiding it.

46
00:02:24.312 --> 00:02:27.392
Today you can go gather evidence.

47
00:02:27.552 --> 00:02:29.912
It could be something as simple as making a phone call.

48
00:02:30.072 --> 00:02:33.232
Maybe there's something you've been putting off.

49
00:02:33.392 --> 00:02:36.352
Maybe you need to call a family member.

50
00:02:36.512 --> 00:02:39.032
Maybe you need to call your boss.

51
00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:41.352
Maybe you need to make some sort of call.

52
00:02:41.512 --> 00:02:44.592
And you've been avoiding it because you feel uncomfortable.

53
00:02:44.752 --> 00:02:47.312
Today you can gather evidence.

54
00:02:47.472 --> 00:02:50.112
But the key is you have to take action.

55
00:02:50.352 --> 00:02:52.912
If you want to build your confidence, action is the only way.

56
00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:56.312
Remember, confidence is built on evidence.

57
00:02:56.512 --> 00:02:59.232
Evidence that you can handle it.

58
00:02:59.392 --> 00:03:01.912
Evidence that you can do it.

59
00:03:02.072 --> 00:03:04.112
Evidence that you can create a certain outcome.

60
00:03:04.312 --> 00:03:07.032
So today, go do something courageous.

61
00:03:07.192 --> 00:03:09.152
Something that makes you feel fear.

62
00:03:09.392 --> 00:03:12.272
Something that makes you feel uncomfortable.

63
00:03:12.432 --> 00:03:15.112
It doesn't have to be huge.

64
00:03:15.272 --> 00:03:17.672
Start small if you need to.

65
00:03:17.832 --> 00:03:20.192
But you have to gather evidence today.

66
00:03:20.352 --> 00:03:22.272
And then tomorrow, I'm going to talk to you about something else.

67
00:03:22.432 --> 00:03:25.112
A tool that you can use to build confidence.

68
00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:28.112
So go do that courageous thing today.

69
00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:29.792
And I'll see you tomorrow.

70
00:03:30.754 --> 00:03:33.914
Let's talk about another way to build confidence.

71
00:03:34.154 --> 00:03:37.354
This one's a big one, and it's really important.

72
00:03:37.514 --> 00:03:40.394
Because if you want to be confident with women,

73
00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:43.394
one of the most important things you need to be able to do is handle rejection.

74
00:03:43.554 --> 00:03:46.714
You need to be able to handle rejection.

75
00:03:46.874 --> 00:03:49.194
Now, rejection is something that all men fear.

76
00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:52.194
We all fear rejection.

77
00:03:52.354 --> 00:03:54.714
We fear being told no.

78
00:03:54.874 --> 00:03:57.194
We fear being embarrassed.

79
00:03:57.354 --> 00:04:00.194
We fear feeling shame.

80
00:04:00.354 --> 00:04:03.514
But I want you to remember this.

81
00:04:03.674 --> 00:04:05.914
Rejection does not define you.

82
00:04:06.154 --> 00:04:08.714
Rejection does not define you.

83
00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:11.514
Rejection is simply feedback.

84
00:04:11.674 --> 00:04:14.394
Rejection is simply feedback.

85
00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:17.194
It's feedback about what somebody wants.

86
00:04:17.354 --> 00:04:20.034
It's feedback about what somebody likes.

87
00:05:10.754 --> 00:05:11.974
I'm Robbie and I'll see you tomorrow.
